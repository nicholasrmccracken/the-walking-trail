## Introduction
Dangerous bandits, hoards, and famine all await you as you try to deliver the cure to the zombie apocalypse to Washington D.C:
- Navigate through complex situational events in the midst of the zombie apocalypse, each with probabilistic outcomes based on your chosen response. 
- Manage the health and wealth of a party of five unique characters via pace control, rationing of food, water, and medicine, as well as the resources you choose to purchase when you 
visit the shop. 
- Survive to the given date to stake your claim as the ultimate post-apocalyptic survivor.
